# Guard::Compass
#
# You don't need to configure watchers for guard 'compass' declaration as they generated
# from your Compass configuration file. You might need to define the Compass working directory
# and point to the configuration file depending of your project structure.
#
# Available options:
#
# * :workging_directory => Define the Compass working directory, relative to the Guardfile directory
# * :configuration_file => Path to the Compass configuration file, relative to :project_path
#
# Like usual, the Compass configuration path are relative to the :project_path

# guard 'compass', :project_path => 'not_current_dir', :configuration_file => 'path/to/my/compass_config.rb'
guard :compass

guard :jammit do
  watch(%r{^app/scripts/(.*)\.js$})
  watch(%r{^app/scripts/(.*)\.ejs$})
  watch(%r{^public/css/(.*)\.css$})
end

# guard 'livereload' do
#   watch(%r{app/views/.+\.(erb|haml|slim)$})
#   watch(%r{app/helpers/.+\.rb})
#   watch(%r{public/.+\.(css|js|html)})
#   watch(%r{config/locales/.+\.yml})
#   # Rails Assets Pipeline
#   watch(%r{(app|vendor)(/assets/\w+/(.+\.(css|js|html|png|jpg))).*}) { |m| "/assets/#{m[3]}" }
